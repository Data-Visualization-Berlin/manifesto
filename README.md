It's all about your visions, and helping them to become also ours

### Purposes

Back your visions with tools, competency, debate, experience and friendship

#### Enthusiasm and Quality

Those two rarely come together, but if you can afford the price of sharing your
idea, many heads can make it real!

#### Innovate

Yes, innovate. Sometimes it's just too hard to do that in companies or
universities, they already have their schemas and they cannot afford to fail.
It's also difficult to do that alone, since too many different skills are
needed. So here we are.

### Principles

#### Hands on

#### Everything can be discussed

And changed

#### No barriers

As far as we can eliminate them

#### Everyone is empowered, and responsible

If there is something wrong, then help us to improve it. If we are not
providing you the right means, you should get them

#### Multiplicity and variety is normal and welcome

You should be willing to learn several languages, but still stick to one in
order to allow everyone to understand

#### This is a place for sharing

This means we don't have any reason to hide anything produced for this group by
its members.  If we will collect some software, it will be free software. This
applies to icons, guides, videos, and all deliverables.
