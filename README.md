It's all about your visions, and helping them to become also ours

### Purposes

Back your visions with tools, competency, debate, experience and friendship

#### Enthusiasm and Quality

Those two rarely come together, but if you can afford the price of sharing your
idea, many heads can make it real!

### Principles

#### Hands on

#### Everything can be discussed

And changed

#### No barriers

As far as we can eliminate them

#### Everyone is empowered, and responsible

If there is something wrong, then help us to improve it. If we are not
providing you the right means, you should get them

#### Multiplicity and variety is normal and welcome

You should be willing to learn several languages, but still stick to one in
order to allow everyone to understand
